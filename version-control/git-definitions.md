# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows coders to view the history of revisions made to files. It is useful because coders can edit a piece of code and there is a log of the changes for future coders using the same piece of code. We can find bugs and figure out the priority for fixing different bugs.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a "path" that allows separate editing and revision storage mechanisms. I would use a branch to store a response to a survey or document that multiple people edit or answer. This way I could get answers from each person and merge the two versions together.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is an edit to a document or file. It is a way to place text from code directly to a file from the command line. A good commit message returns a 4-6 line message that indicated a change has been made to a file.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is the message that git sends when you try to merge multiple branches. You will be prompted to fix the conflict then try to remerge the branches.
