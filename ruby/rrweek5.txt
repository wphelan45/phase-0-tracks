1. I can use data structures to store a lot of data and create a virtual infrastructure. Then, I can retrieve specific items from the infrastructure.

2. An array is an index that stores information like, strings and integers. All arrays are zero indexed like all other normal strings and etc. This is useful because I can call specific positions from the array.

3. Examples of datasets that arrays are good for storing are strings like: days of the week=[“Mon”, “Tues”, “Wed”]. animals=[“Lions”, “Tigers”, “Bears”].

4. A hash is a dataset that is accessed by keys. The keys are created using a string and => string. The second string is the key.

5. I made a hash dataset of animal exhibits at a zoo in assignment 5.4. Another useful dataset hashes are useful for are translator applications.

6. Iteration is useful for retrieving information from arrays and hashes.

7. Encrypting and decrypting passwords using hashes or arrays to jumble the data.

8. A block is a section of code that can be used to retrieve information or define a method for use later.

9. A block parameter is used to access information and is usually a variable that depends on the method that is being called.
